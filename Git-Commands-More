Branches are best used when doing a pull request (unless the pull request is very small or few people work on the repository).

The steps to take would be:

  Fork a repository on GitHub                                               git branch <fixing-branch-name>
  Clone it onto your computer                                               
  Make a branch and move to it:                                             git checkout -b <fixing-branch-name>
  Make changes to the files
  Commit the changes to the history                                         git add .
                                                                            git status
                                                                            git commit -m "Commit-message"
                                                                    
  Push the branch up to your forked version:                                git push origin <fixing-branch-name>
  On GitHub, submit a Pull Request of your fixingBranch
  Once the pull request is merged, delete the fixingBranch on your forked repo on GitHub and on your computer   
                                                                            git checkout master && 
                                                                            git pull upstream master && 
                                                                            git branch -d fixingBranch
